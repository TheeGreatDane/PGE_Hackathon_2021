# PGE_Hackathon_2021
Energy A.I. Hackathon 2021

Goal: develop a data analytics and machine learning workflow in Python to predict estimates and uncertainty models for cumulative oil 3 year production for 10 unproduced wells.

Background

We challenge the Energy A.I. hackathon teams of The University of Texas at Austin, engineering and science Students to build a data-driven model to predict oil production. This will require:

- Data analysis and evaluation of multiple data sources and a variety of features
- Integration of domain expertise
- Training and tuning robust machine learning prediction models
- Integration and modeling of uncertainty

This data-driven approach will replace the conventional engineering and geoscience approach:

- Characterizing and modeling the subsurface
- Physics-based fluid flow simulations
